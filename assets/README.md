# Code Refactor Starter Code

* This is the first project of my coding bootcamp. 

* First I added Semantic HTML to the code provided. Then I cleaned up the CSS code to reduce duplicating styles. 

* Next I added alt text to the images. To add alt text to the image housed in the CSS I folled a guide from this website http://www.davidmacd.com/blog/alternate-text-for-css-background-images.html.
