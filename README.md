# Horiseon
Module 1 Challenge

This is my first project in my bootcamp. For this project we were given code and instrcuted to refactor the code. 

First, I added semantic HTML elements to make the page easier for future developers to understand. I added a nav, main, aside and footer tag. 

Next, I added alt text to make the page accessible. I added a span to the hero section of the HMTL to allow me to add alt text to the image placed in the css code. 

Then, I added a title of Horiseon to the page and comments to my code to make it easier to understand. 

Finally, I condensed the CSS code to reduce redundancy.
